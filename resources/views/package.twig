    <h3>Selection Process</h3>
    <p>
        The call for speakers closes {{ site.enddate | date("l, F j, Y") }} at 11:59pm CDT (-5 GMT). Once the deadline has
        passed the speaker committee will begin reviewing applications. All applicants will be
        notified regarding the status of their talk/talks in early June. If you submit
        multiple talks you will only receive one response.
    </p>
    <h3>Tips for Submission</h3>
    <p>
        We encourage potential speakers to upload more than one pitch, but no more than two submissions
        will be accepted from an applicant. If you choose to submit more than two, the first two will
        be the only pitches considered. Be sure your talk description/abstract defines the exact topic
        you want to talk about and what you hope people will learn from your session.
    </p>
